# car_price_prediction
Car Price Prediction System designed to estimate vehicle prices using machine learning techniques.
The project leverages a Random Forest Regressor to analyze various car attributes, including engine size, horsepower, and fuel efficiency, to predict car prices with high accuracy.  Key features of the project include:  Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data to prepare it for model training. Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to predict car prices based on historical sales data, with performance evaluated through metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score. GUI Implementation: Developed a user-friendly interface using Tkinter, allowing users to input car features and receive real-time price predictions. Model Deployment: The trained model and encoding transformations are saved and loaded using joblib, ensuring consistent predictions and easy deployment.
